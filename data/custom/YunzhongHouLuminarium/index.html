<h1 onclick="slidePanel('story')">The Gift of Inara</h1>
<div id="story" class="infocus">
<p class="narrationleft">
Inara shone as a beacon of light.
<br>
<br>It shone in the dawn from its sunbeams bright;
<br>it shone all aglow from magical might;
<br>it shone from the armor of ranks of knights;
<br>it shone with the flight of a thousand living lights.
<br>Its truly was a gift from the heavens.
</p>
<p class="narrationright">
<br>Then the heavens dropped a gift on Inara.
</p>
<p class="narrationleft">
<br>It was a gift a match for a city, and Inara met its maker. Fire and 
flame incinerated the living, and shockwaves flattened all the rest. 
Inara was gone, and its people dead.
<br>
<br>The king was dead. So was the prince and heir apparent and the rest 
of the royal family. So was anyone else of great power. The only people 
of power left were the nobles scattered throughout the country, and none
 of them had enough power to usurp the entire empire. They couldn't even
 usurp the crown and throne of Inara, because there <i>was</i> no crown 
or throne left of Inara. Nothing was left. All that was left was a 
crater half a mile deep and half a dozen miles wide. Half the country 
fell into tumult, and they were the ones who knew what was coming. For 
who knew what was coming? No one knew, and that meant that war was 
coming.
<br>
<br>War... War always changes. War always changes everything. And with 
the fall of Inara and the rise of competing factions sweeping across the
 land, you know it will come and change you too. And yet you embrace the
 change, for with change comes opportunity, and with opportunities come 
choice. And so you chose to embrace your destiny. For what is destiny 
but choices made and opportunities embraced?
<br>
</p>
<p class="narration">
And so you chose your destiny.

Destiny begins with birth, as they say. Who you're born to matters more 
than who you know or what you do. Witness the common farmer tilling the 
soil; what destiny shall he have? Yet many are the tales of a farmer boy
 growing up to accomplish great things. Witness the king atop his 
throne; surely he's at his apex, with nowhere to go? Well, he's gone 
now, as is his throne, and his palace, and his city, and his empire.

The Luminaran power economy is based on the above gemstones, through 
which great power can be obtained: physical abilities with vitalite, 
intellectual abilities with spiritite, and spellcasting abilities with 
magicite. The columns on the right list out the requirements (negative 
values) or sources (positive values) by color: Red is vitalite, blue is 
magicite, purple is spiritite, and gold is gold.
<br>
<br>Below follow numerous sections detailing abilities you can get, paid
 for with various gemstones; you can of course mix and match any 
combination of these, provided you are wealthy enough. So long as you 
have the money, you can buy yourself more gemstones; and if you have the
 wrong ones, you can exchange them. If you still find yourself running 
out of gems, or the choices are all too tempting for you to pass up on 
any of them, don't despair. Look carefully, and you will find hidden 
opportunities.<br></p>
